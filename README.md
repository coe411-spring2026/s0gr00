# COE411L-00 Report 1
## Introduction

This is our introduction to the first report of our COE411 lab. We should probably write a lot of information that demonstrates our understanding of the material.

## Description
Tell me what system(s) did you build and how they work

## Circuit Diagram
Show your CrikitDesigner diagram

![CirkitDesigner diagram.](/images/circuit_image_github.png)

## Key Code Segments
This is where you describe the code you added and briefly explain what it does. For example, the code below makes the LED blink with a delay of 1 second:
```
	  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5);
	  HAL_Delay(1000);
```

## System Photo
If applicable

## Screenshots
If applicable

## Some extra helpers
### This is a third level header
### Below is a list
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3


The Read-Me should include all information you'd typically include in a technical report. Anyone going through the repo should understand everything that happened without ever looking at the handout.
Refer to the [GitHub docs] (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more help.
