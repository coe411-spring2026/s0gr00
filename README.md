# COE411L-00 Report 1
## Introduction

This is our introduction to the first report of our COE411 lab. We should probably write a lot of information that demonstrates our understanding of the material.

## Description
Tell me what system(s) did you build and how they work

##Circuit Diagram
![CirkitDesigner diagram.](/images/base-octocat.svg)

## Key Code Segments
This is where you describe the code you added and briefly explain what it does





## Guidelines

### Content and Structure

- Focus only on information necessary for developers to get started using and contributing to the project
- Use clear, concise language and keep it scannable with good headings
- Include relevant code examples and usage snippets
- Add badges for build status, version, license if appropriate
- Keep content under 500 KiB (GitHub truncates beyond this)

Analyze the project structure, dependencies, and code to make the README accurate, helpful, and focused on getting users productive quickly.
